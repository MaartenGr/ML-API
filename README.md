# Deploying your Machine Learning Model   

This repository contains code and instructions on how to deploy your
machine learning model using a production-ready API.

I am using FastAPI + Uvicorn to serve the model which creates automatic
documentation using OpenAPI (Swagger) and ReDoc.

The Dockerfile is included if you would like to containerize the application
and deploy it on the cloud.
